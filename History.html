            <p>Pavlova is a meringue-based dessert named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova.
                It is a meringue dessert with a crisp crust and soft, light inside, usually topped with fruit and,
                optionally, whipped cream. The name is pronounced "pævˈloʊvə",
                unlike the name of the dancer, which was "ˈpɑːvləvə".

                The dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer
                either during or after one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s </p>

            <p>The dessert is a popular dish and an important part of the national
                cuisine of both Australia and New Zealand, even though the two nations still argues today about which
            nation is its creator. <br>
                The first known recorded recipe named "pavlova" was published in the fifth Australian
                edition of Davis Dainty Dishes in 1926. However this "pavlova" recipe was not meringue
                based, but was instead a multi-coloured gelatine dish.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, according to Keith Money, a biographer of Anna Pavlova,
                wrote that a hotel chef in Wellington, New Zealand, created the dish when
                Pavlova visited there in 1926 on her world tour.</p>

            <p>Research has given us several different explanations and dates, some recipes that were found
            are the real Pavlova recipe, and some are very similar. But the definite answer seems to be out of reach.
            Matthew Evans, a restaurant critic said "People have been doing meringue with cream for a long time,
                I don't think Australia or New Zealand were the first to think of doing that."<br>
            To strengthen this argument, research conducted by Dr Andrew Paul Wood, a New Zealander,
                and Australian Annabelle Utrecht found that the origins of the modern pavlova can be
                traced back to Germany, where it began life as a German torte. It was later brought to
                America where it evolved into its final form.</p>
